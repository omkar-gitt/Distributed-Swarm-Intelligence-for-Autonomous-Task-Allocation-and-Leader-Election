# Distributed-Swarm-Intelligence-for-Autonomous-Task-Allocation-and-Leader-Election
A fully distributed swarm algorithm developed for the SWAVLAMBAN 2025 Hackathon. The project implements fast leader election, capability-aware task allocation, and stable coordination among autonomous agents operating under low-bandwidth and unreliable communication conditions.
